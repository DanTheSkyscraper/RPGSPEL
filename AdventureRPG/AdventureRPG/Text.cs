It is a fact that the area where you live has some of the most crowded streets this side of the city, yet you have not seen hide nor hair of a single person ever since you stepped out of that door. No one is at the Bus Stop, and there is not a single vehicle driving on the road as far as the eye can see.

It is a world parallell to our own, except this is where everything we know as myth, legend or fantasy comes to life. In other words, everything we humans think of as myths, legends, monster and more, exist here.¨");

No one knows where we are, but every single person that has come here have learnt one thing: Do not, under any circumstances, try and act diplomatically towards the being that reside here. They do not think. They do not feel. They do not sleep, nor do they need to eat and drink. The only things we have discovered that they do is exist and kill. We found that out the hard way.
